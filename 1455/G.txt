Polycarp is editing a complicated computer program. First, variable x is declared and assigned to 0.
 Then there are instructions of two types:   set y v — assign x a value y or spend v burles to remo
ve that instruction (thus, not reassign x);  if y \dots end block — execute instructions inside the
 if block if the value of x is y and ignore the block otherwise. if blocks can contain set instruct
ions and other if blocks inside them.However, when the value of x gets assigned to s, the computer 
breaks and immediately catches fire. Polycarp wants to prevent that from happening and spend as few
 burles as possible.What is the minimum amount of burles he can spend on removing set instructions 
to never assign x to s?InputThe first line contains two integers n and s (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5,
 1 \le s \le 2 \cdot 10^5) — the number of lines in the program and the forbidden value of x.The fo
llowing n lines describe the program. Each line is one of three types:   set y v (0 \le y \le 2 \cd
ot 10^5, 1 \le v \le 10^9);  if y (0 \le y \le 2 \cdot 10^5);  end. Each if instruction is matched 
by an end instruction. Each end instruction has an if instruction to match.OutputPrint a single int
eger — the minimum amount of burles Polycarp can spend on removing set instructions to never assign
 x to s.ExamplesInput
