You are standing on the \mathit{OX}-axis at point 0 and you want to move to an integer point x > 0.Y
ou can make several jumps. Suppose you're currently at point y (y may be negative) and jump for the
 k-th time. You can:   either jump to the point y + k  or jump to the point y - 1. What is the mini
mum number of jumps you need to reach the point x?InputThe first line contains a single integer t (
1 \le t \le 1000) — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains the
 single integer x (1 \le x \le 10^6) — the destination point.OutputFor each test case, print the si
ngle integer — the minimum number of jumps to reach x. It can be proved that we can reach any integ
er point x.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case x = 1, so you need 
only one jump: the 1-st jump from 0 to 0 + 1 = 1.In the second test case x = 2. You need at least t
hree jumps:   the 1-st jump from 0 to 0 + 1 = 1;  the 2-nd jump from 1 to 1 + 2 = 3;  the 3-rd jump
 from 3 to 3 - 1 = 2; Two jumps are not enough because these are the only possible variants:   the 
1-st jump as -1 and the 2-nd one as -1 — you'll reach 0 -1 -1 =-2;  the 1-st jump as -1 and the 2-n
d one as +2 — you'll reach 0 -1 +2 = 1;  the 1-st jump as +1 and the 2-nd one as -1 — you'll reach 
0 +1 -1 = 0;  the 1-st jump as +1 and the 2-nd one as +2 — you'll reach 0 +1 +2 = 3; In the third t
est case, you need two jumps: the 1-st one as +1 and the 2-nd one as +2, so 0 + 1 + 2 = 3.In the fo
urth test case, you need three jumps: the 1-st one as -1, the 2-nd one as +2 and the 3-rd one as +3
, so 0 - 1 + 2 + 3 = 4.
